I created this repository for two reasons. First, I wanted to
incorporate Git and GitHub into my workflow, so I could give
myself an opportunity to practice the technologies. Second, I
wanted to show my work. That is, I used C and Vim on a Fedora
36 system in a VirtualBox environment to create, use, and
manage directories and files as I work through Prata's C Primer
Plus textbook.

Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions
or comments. In addition, feel free to utilize the solutions
for your consumption and edificiation.

Note: My Fedora 36 virtual system utilizes 4GB of RAM and 100GB
of Storage on 4 cores, provisioned from my Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
system, which has 32GB of RAM and 2TB of Storage on 8 cores.

Technical Notes and Considerations
------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile and execute the Chapter 3 files,

    (1) copy the code and paste it directly into your preferred
        Integrated Development Environment (IDE), CLion, CodeLite,
        or Code::Blocks, for example, or your preferred text editor,
        Vim, Nano, or Emacs, for example,
    (2) and either build and run the files in your IDE
    (3) or use the following command-line scripts:

            $ gcc file_name.c -o main
            $ ./main
